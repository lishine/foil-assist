Disclaimer - I am not an expert in any of the fields. I am just a curious person, who is trying to learn and share the knowledge. At this point, I haven't had the opportunity to try foil yet. my experience is limited to Race SUP.

As I gather information for my own future project, I've created this Knowledge Base, Wiki, or Documentation. My hope is for it to evolve into an organized and easily accessible source of information, especially for those embarking on their new foil-related ventures.

The great thing is, we can collaborate on editing the website! No specialized technical knowledge is required; the pages are written in markdown, similar to the format used in forums.

This website or application aims to present information in the most organized, structured, and accessible manner possible, utilizing the latest technological tools available. While I acknowledge that collaborative editing (a bit like a Wiki) is possible on the forum, I believe we can do more.

I will try to connect the website to the foil.zone forum as much as possible.

In my vision, this platform will be like a wizard that guides enthusiasts along a _joyful_ path. With just a few clicks, users can receive an assessment of:

1. The recommended approach to achieve their goals.
2. The necessary skills.
3. The required components.

Currently, the world of water sports is centered around foil technology. Getting on a foil is a crucial step, as it serves as a gateway to water sports. Electric foils are making this possible, and over time, they are likely to become more affordable and accessible.
