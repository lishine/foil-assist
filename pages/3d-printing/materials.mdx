#### Material Considerations

- ABS, ASA, Polycarbonate - require closed heated chamber in order not to wrap
- Polymaker PC PolyMax - filaments are produced not pure polycarbonate, but with additives, including these that prevent wrapping. So for smaller prints it may be possible to print without a heated chamber.
- For stronger prints suggested to use PLA+, PLA-ST, CF PLA, CF PETG, Nylon CF, Polycarbonate CF
