#### Electrical

- Soldering thicker phase wires

> Use liquid electrical tape on the wiring solder joins at the motor, or plenty of silicone inside heatshrink - @Jatem

#### Waterproofing

> Use liquid electrical tape on the wiring solder joins at the motor, or plenty of silicone inside heatshrink.

> Coat the stator thinly with epoxy so that it can be cooled by water. Fill the gaps between magnets on the bell with epoxy (with microballons) to protect them from rusting and reduce drag.

- replace the motor bearings with stainless steel or ceramic

Another approach - treat with Corossion X / ACF-50 dip frequently /Cyclo Fusion 3.0 corrosion inhibitor:

> s9tim:I have been running my 120kv motor with the magnets filled and dipped in corrosion x every 6 runs for 9 months now, probably over 100 hours of saltwater use with only light corrosion showing on the outer bell housing. I change the bearings out with the same cheap stainless ones every 20 hours or so.
