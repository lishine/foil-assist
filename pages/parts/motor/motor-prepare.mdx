6384 motor preparing\

- soldering thicker phase wires
- Coat the stator thinly with epoxy so that it can be cooled by water.
- Fill the gaps between magnets on the bell with epoxy (with microballons) to protect them from rusting and reduce drag
- replace the motor bearings with stainless steel or ceramic
- remove shaft\

- another approach - treat with Corossion X / ACF-50 dip frequently /Cyclo Fusion 3.0 corrosion inhibitor

> s9tim:I have been running my 120kv motor with the magnets filled and dipped in corrosion x every 6 runs for 9 months now, probably over 100 hours of saltwater use with only light corrosion showing on the outer bell housing. I change the bearings out with the same cheap stainless ones every 20 hours or so.
