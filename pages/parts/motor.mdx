### Motor Choice

- 6384 150kv 10sbattery
- 6374 170kv 6s battery
- most people use 120kv, with vesc can be run with 12s
- 6384 sensorless
- freerchobby 6384 bettery quality
- must have the mount holes - saite copy
- maybe 140kv/170v with 10s
- apex motors
- Larsb: Normally itâ€™s best to choose the lowest kV you can reach your rpm goal with but you can get away with a lot if the system just is well balanced in motor-esc-battery capability

### Motor treatment and prepar

soldering thicker phase wires
Coat the stator thinly with epoxy so that it can be cooled by water. Fill the gaps between magnets on the bell with epoxy (with microballons) to protect them from rusting and reduce drag
t-dub-maui: replaced the motor bearings with stainless steel (thanks @Thaiguy for the info on what to buy) and soaked everything in CorrosionX. Hopefully that will keep it working for a while.

Corossion X / ACF-50 dip frequently /Cyclo Fusion 3.0 corrosion inhibitor
s9tim:I have been running my 120kv motor with the magnets filled and dipped in corrosion x every 6 runs for 9 months now, probably over 100 hours of saltwater use with only light corrosion showing on the outer bell housing. I change the bearings out with the same cheap stainless ones every 20 hours or so.
