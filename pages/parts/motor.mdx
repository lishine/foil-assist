## Choice

- 6384 150kv 8s battery
- 6374 170kv 6s battery
- 6384 120kv 10s/12s battery

**must have the mount holes - saite copy**

- choose sensorless

> most people use 120kv

> Normally it's best to choose the lowest kV you can reach your rpm goal with but you can get away with a lot if the system just is well balanced in motor-esc-battery capability - @Larsb

### Electrical

- Soldering thicker phase wires

> Use liquid electrical tape on the wiring solder joins at the motor, or plenty of silicone inside heatshrink - @Jatem

### Waterproofing

> Use liquid electrical tape on the wiring solder joins at the motor, or plenty of silicone inside heatshrink.

> Coat the stator thinly with epoxy so that it can be cooled by water. Fill the gaps between magnets on the bell with epoxy (with microballons) to protect them from rusting and reduce drag.

- replace the motor bearings with stainless steel or ceramic

#### Covering with epoxy

#### Preparing with epoxy primer

- 2k Automotive
  > For the Stator, I just painted mine. Quaility paint, and that worked for 2 years without problem. To much epoxy on the windings will give heat problems. -- @Toto44
- Sigmacover 280 epoxy paint - @BasNL

#### Another approach - treat with Corossion X / ACF-50 dip frequently /Cyclo Fusion 3.0 corrosion inhibitor:

> I have been running my 120kv motor with the magnets filled and dipped in corrosion x every 6 runs for 9 months now, probably over 100 hours of saltwater use with only light corrosion showing on the outer bell housing. I change the bearings out with the same cheap stainless ones every 20 hours or so -- @s9tim

### Opening 6384

> Inside the stator, the stator base can also be reached via the socket. Place a washer on the can and knock out the base with a punch or long screw and hammer. You hold the stator in your hand. First of all, of course, take out all the bearings -- @hangloose

> Yes, some of them have some epoxy on the wires that sticks to the housing. I always heat mine up now before removing the stator and haven’t had any issues -- @Jesserosco

#### How to make shrink wrap waterproof

1. > I’ve used liquid tape + shrink to seal the joints without issues for three years. I guess the joint with heat shrink protection is still good enough even if the liquid tape could probably be peeled off the silicone if you tried. -- @Larsb
2. > Liquid tape is rubber, not silicone. Silicone is far superior for waterproofing connections. A better method:
   > place geocel marine silicone around solder joint.
   > Shrink wrap the wet silicone
   > wait 24 hrs for it to dry
   > I’ve done this and have connections that are over 3 years old that are still waterproof. The benefit is that if you use silicone cable the bond to the cable is permanent. -- @Jezza
