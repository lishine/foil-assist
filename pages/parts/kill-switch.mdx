#### Trigger

- Manually
- Attaching additional leash or maybe leash of the board to the outside part of the switch

#### Cut-off element

- High current relay
- VESC ADC input - it is a feature of VESC to cut-off the power when the voltage on the ADC input is below some threshold

#### Switch Sensor

Switch sensor together with magnets is attached to the box inside. Magnets on the outside used to hold the outside part on the box. Additionally on outside magnet or metal used to trigger the sensor.
