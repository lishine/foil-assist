It has 3 data pins - signal, gnd, tx.
Signal either connected to the receiver or to bluetoth programmer.
Programming is done throught BLHeli32 software - it has many options.
This ESC has telemetry on the tx pin. Usually the telemetry is used through flight controller.

This ESC seems as good and robust option. The downside it that for telemetry or logging have to use VESC.
