> VESC allows a lot of tuning and monitoring, including a soft ramp on startup which should make printed props last longer

FLYCOLOR ESC FLYDRAGON-Pro-80A-HV3:

> you want the v3 version. It has the heat reduction programming which actually works. Unfortunately the v3 version only has timing that can be changed. It does not have low voltage cutoff or over temp cutoff. The v2 has all these features but it doesnt have the heat reduction option. This esc doesnt get hot with the externalized cooling plate, and I know when the voltage is getting too low. \
> I have used the v3 now a dozen times. I have 3 flipsky vesc that i have used , all with over 100amp capacity and after all the trials/ fooling around with settings etc etc etc, I have found a Simple/Small/Able/Extremely inexpensive ESC that I Love. I will never go back to the Vesc -- @gzmann

> BDLC controllers are more efficient than VESC for Foil assistant - @rttn

#### Esc cooling

- Thermal pad
- High temp epoxy
- 3m 5200 fast cure to glue through the box
- Important: cooiling enough the Esc
