HyperDrive from Propellerking
3D printed prop from Leachim

- Max mechanical power is at around 70% of free spin rpm. So 0.7×120\*25 = 2100 rpm. Increase the pitch and/or diameter until your rpm under load are like that. Mind you, motor efficiency at max mech power is quite low
- vib.dxb: i m running on 12S and I fly above water…I can catch a waves passing me …but Id did kill 3 or 4 propeler from propeler king…si moved to drive assist alumnium + nylon hub (same price as eml store)
