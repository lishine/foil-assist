#### 100kv or 120kv

> 9.55/kV multiplied by motor current gives torque so you need 20% more motor current with the 120kV motor, but it has the same torque capability.
> This means that if you have an esc that can output enough current the 120kV motor will work equally well but give you a bit higher speed.
> I’m 100kg, have used both 100kV motor and 120kV, can’t say i notice any large difference when riding. I rarely go full speed though so the extra speed isn’t what i focus on. - @Larsb
